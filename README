mazegen
=======

mazegen is a C++ program that uses graphs to generate and solve mazes. It used
to produce and solve only ASCII art mazes, but that wasn't cool enough, so now
it does HTML too. Well, it generates HTML. It currently still only solves ASCII
mazes that look something like this::

    + +-+-+-+
    | |     |
    + + + +-+
    |   |    
    +-+-+-+-+

Yes, it reads ASCII art and solves it. You read that right.

In the future, it will also read the HTML mazes and solve them, or produce an
optional solved version of the maze at the same time that it generates one.


Graph Implementation
====================

There is a bare-bones implementation of a graph in this project that might be
useful to you if you're just learning how graphs work. Check out Graph.cpp and
Edge.cpp for your learning pleasure.
